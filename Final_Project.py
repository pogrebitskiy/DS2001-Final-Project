Research Question: 
How do various quantitative pieces of financial data affect and correlate with 
 their companyâ€™s current share price?

We are interested in the intersection of data science and finance and hope to 
 analyze any possible correlations between financial data and closing stock
 price. We became interested in this topic after watching an interview with Jim
 Simons. He tracked the correlation between an uncountable amount of variables
 and stock prices. It is commonly said that they tracked this correlation
 between stock price and almost every possible variable that could be tracked
 over time.

---
Our Data:
Our data consists of Compustat and Yahoo Finance exported csv files for our two
  companies, Apple and Google.
We collected the quarterly data from Jan 2000 - Jan 2021 for all major
 collected financial data on Compustat, and the monthly close price data
 on Yahoo Finance.

We have over 600 variables for the 84 quarters in our time range, with an
  entry representing an equivalent value on the 10-Q or 10-K. An empty space
 represents 0 or N/A, as provided by Compustat.
Relevant variables will be taken when needed using the following key:
 https://www.crsp.org/products/documentation/quarterly-data-industrial
 Stock price data was taken from one csv and imported into the df.

---
Data Analysis:
We are working with dataframes using pandas to simplify how we worked with the
 data.
Our functions either calculate a ratio and add it to our dataframe, or graph
 the ratio against the stock price.
For each function, we calculated the correlation betweeen stock price and the
 associated ratio and reported this.

---
Data Interpretation:
After analyzing the 8 apple and 7 google graphs, it is clear that certain
 metrics and relationships are hard to predict, even across companies in the
 same industry.
For example, in the case of apple and google's current ratios, it is extremely
 unexpected for apple's to be very close to 1 in comparison to google's 3.
Our graphs are extremely easy to follow by being labeled and titled. We also
 graphed the linear regression for the information.
Our next steps include analyzing more companies in the tech industry and
 possibly branching off into other industries.
We also hope to analyze the most 5 or 10 years instead of just the last
 20 years, since the tech industry is constantly innovating.
